To run this code you must import the jupyter notebook
file into google colab. Make sure, before you start to
run all the cells to change your run time to any of the
available GPU to TPU. Note the TPU may run better since
I've used TensorFlow.

Note that I was not able to place the dataset into this
zip file but here is the link for the dataset found in 
kaggle.

You may also find the link when you run the first cell in
notebook.

Instructions:
At the very top click the "Runtime" tab then press run all. 
This will run all the cells individually.

Important Information
-The last two cells and the cell 3 sections after training are 
the most important. These cells will show you how the bbox that the model predicts in Yellow and the actual cell in green. They will have titles. Also, some of the license plates have strange and inappropriate names so I apologize in advance for those. I had also purchased Colab Plus, if the usage is to high and running out, 10 epochs will give a relatively good prediction.
